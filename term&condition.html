        <div class="terms-text">
          Mavy Fintech LLP acts solely as a payment processor for the client and
          does not have control over the activities or actions of the business
          it assists in processing payments.
          <br />
          Mavy Fintech LLP will not be responsible for any disputes between the
          users and payers/payees, including issues related to prices, delivery,
          non-delivery, delay in delivery, or the quality of products. Such
          disputes must be resolved directly between the user and the
          payer/payee, and Mavy Fintech LLP will not be a party to these
          disputes.
          <br />
          Mavy Fintech LLP cannot and does not guarantee the timing of any
          payments made or received, as the timing depends on the user's bank,
          card issuing bank/card processor (if a credit/debit card is used),
          acquiring financial institutions, and other service providers. Mavy
          Fintech LLP assumes no liability and shall not be held responsible for
          any delays in payment delivery or availability of funds when using the
          services.
          <br />
          Mavy Fintech LLP shall not be a party to any agreement between the
          user and any payer/payee. All contracts are directly between the users
          and their payers/payees.
          <br />
          The user is responsible for any miscommunication or incorrect
          user/third-party/other information provided to Mavy Fintech LLP when
          enabling the services.
          <br />
          If a bank or legal authorities request to block an account or place a
          lien on any amount of the client's funds, Mavy Fintech LLP will pass
          the request on to the client. The lien on the amount or unblocking of
          the account will occur only once cleared by the bank or the relevant
          authorities.
          <br />
          Mavy Fintech LLP and the service provider reserve the right to impose
          limits on the number of transactions that may be charged to an account
          during any time period and may refuse payments for transactions that
          exceed such limits. They also reserve the right to refuse payments for
          transactions by users with a prior history of questionable charges.
